  Why did they call him the Duke of Tralee? Millions of Irish died or fled for
  their lives because of the potato famine. Roger Bresnahanâ€™s father survived,
  because at just 15 he left his family in Tralee, never to see them again. He
  worked 12 hours a day, so he never saw his son Roger play baseball as a kid
  growing up in Toledo.
